The questions are in order, and once you finish the questions you can stop watching (about 30 minutes through). 

Answer the following questions. Each is worth 2 points. You can use any resources you like.

1.	What solutions is there in C++ to having to write multiple structs which may hold doubles, ints, floats, etc (such as IntStruct, DoubleStruct, etc)?
2.	Are templates Turing complete?
3.	What is the C++ equivalent to a C-style array?
4.	How do you make a compile-time constant in C++?
5.	How do you tell the compiler to figure out the type instead of writing it in C++? What keyword do you use?
6.	What are lambdas?
7.	What is a C++ concept?

These are not in the video, but again you can use any resource you like.

8.	What is the file extension for a source code file in C++?
9.	Does C++ have a type for true and false values?
10.	Find a feature of C++ that improves upon something in C. Write a few sentences about it and what you found out.
